A look into the traces of monotheism in pre Abrahamic religions.

<!--more-->


# Introduction:

> **"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying]: 'Worship Allah and avoid false deities."** - Quran: Surah An-Nahl 16:36


Since the time of Aadam and Nuh (AS) there has, as Allah points out multiple times in the Quran, not been a nation in history that did not have a messanger sent to them. How far back does that history go? When did the first nations or cultures start to form?

In this post I'm trying to look as far back as I can in history to find mention in the oldest of holy scriptures of the most important sentence ever spoken: There is no God, but Allah.

Obviously the languages and therefore the wording will change vastly as we look further and further back but the message will stay the same.
