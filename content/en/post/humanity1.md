How we treat each other matters more than what we believe.


<!--more-->


There's something more important in this world than anything else. Something more important than what we believe. How we treat each other matters more. It has to because when it doesn't we get conflict, abuse, terrorism (from governments and cults alike) and war.

Without humanity we fail to live and work together.
