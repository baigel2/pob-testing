Some ideas and tips for myself first, on how I might be able to improve productivity and good Islamic habits. Maybe they'll help you too.

Disclaimer: this post is not me saying: “I’ve figured out life and how to achieve anything to the highest standard and now I’m going to show you how to do the same.

I’m not an internet guru. I’m a normal person who wants to learn and improve at a rate I can manage and maintain for as long as g as possible.

This means balance not Gogginsian levels of extremes.

I am not at the time of writing this post (in my mind at least) a very productive person. I find it extremely hard to manage my time, I frequently misjudge the appropriate order of priorities and I procrastinate a lot.

Often, I have so many ideas in my head that I don’t know where to start, other times my mind is more void of thought than a black hole is of light.

So, in this post I will present to you the tools, systems and ideas I have on how to become more productive as well as anything that has either worked really well or failed miserable.

Ok let’s get right into it with something I do t even want to hear myself and that I’m guessing you might not want to either:

# Sleep.

That evil bed! That evil evil bed! Why is it always most comfortable when you’re supposed to be getting up?

Sleep is probably the most important contributor to or detractor from productivity a quality of life in general depending on its quality.

If you don’t get enough sleep you will not function.

What is the appropriate ammount of sleep? Doctors say on average about 7-8 hours a night. Sounds like too much? Like you won’t have time to get anything done? 

I thought the same thing and once challenged myself to see how little sleep I could get away with.

The short story? It didn’t work. I got down to about 4 to 4 and a half hours but I was drinking unhealthy and probably unsafe amounts of coffee to no effect as well as using caffeinated chewing gum.

None of it was working. The effects of regular caffeine intake trend downward overtime as when you take caffeine you don’t return to baseline performance but you drop down below it so you then have to take more and more over time just to get back to baseline.

Then, I started adding more time back on to my sleep and took it back up to about 6:30/7hrs.

This seems to be the sweet spot for me though I can function ok for a day or two with less than that.

Despite having hours less time in the day I was able to get way more done because my brain (now mostly off caffeine) was actually functioning again.

Once you manage to sort your sleep out then what’s next?

# Salah

Why did I not put salah before sleep? Have you tried praying with no sleep?

But again, there’s a slightly paradoxical effect that you will likely experience when you start incorporating regular prayers into your daily routine.

As you get more regular with prayers you may notice as I have, that you actually have more time in the day when you pray than when you don’t.

Or, when you don’t pray the day seems to go quicker but to the extent that you feel like you weren’t able to get much done because the day just slipped by you.

Whereas if you pray all your obligatory prayers you may notice that the day stretches out to accommodate the tasks you need to get done.

It’s why the excuse “I can’t find time to pray” is just that. An excuse.

When you make time for Allah, Allah literally makes time, for you.

 “But how can I get there?” you ask. “I’m not like those sheiks and imams on YouTube.” 

You think I am?

# Start. Just Start.

That’s how you get there. You get up and go there.

Start small. As small as it takes to build some momentum. Progress is never linear so don’t expect it to be. 

Sleep
Salah
Start. Just start.
A little bit of analogue. (Pocket notebooks).
Maybe a bit of digital (habit kit).
