I wanted to make a blog that focused more on Islam as a pose to just a general blog like [baigelbytes.com](baigelbytes.com).

Also, I've been learning about and exploring Shia Islam for a few months at least as of writing this (05.2025) and I feel like Shia Islam is severely under reprisented in the public eye.

One could say that this is because there are less Shias in the world compared to Sunni's but then there are less vegans in the world compared to non-vegans and you can't go to a western country at least where the term hasn't been at least heard of.

Therefore, the size of a group does not need to be proportionate to how well known they are. And to that end, I hope to spread awareness and knowlege about this side of Islam.

I'm not a scholar or a person of knowlege, I'm not sure I even qualify as a student of knowlege as I'm not registered with any educational bodies within the Islamic world, however I am seeking knowlege and seeking to share what I learn.

In this blog you will see posts about Shia Islam and Sunni Islam as well as any topics relating to religion that catch my interest.

For instance, I'm developing a personal method to make memorising the Quran easier for people who aren't trying to become Imams or Scholars and who don't have the hours a day often nessasary to follow more traditional Hifz methods.
